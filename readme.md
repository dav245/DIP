# Thesis

This thesis should compare different approaches to reactivity, DOM syncing and component design of four selected frameworks. [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/), [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Lit](https://lit.dev/).

## Contents of repository

- Backend - contains server written on top of [Laravel 9](https://laravel.com/). It is simple messaging app
- CommonFrontend - folder, that is accessible from all frontends
- Vue - Frontend written in vue

## What you need to get started

- php 8.1 installed and available on $PATH
- mariadb 10.6.7
- node 18.4.0 with npm 8.12.1

### IDE

During development was used VS Code. Some files are specific to this Code editor and can be ignored if other code editor is used

### On Windows

Best approach is to install [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) + [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Technically you need wamp only for mariadb. Laravel has integrated dev server.

### On Linux

You are really on your own. Though you should be used to that.
